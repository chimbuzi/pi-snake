# pi-snake
Crappy snake game in python for 32x8 neopixel array. TL;DR don't use it until it works a bit more.

# Hardware

* Pi zero
* Pair of push-switches between pins 17 and 27 and ground for inputs
* neopixel array with the data line hooked up to pin 18
* Things installed as per imports.
* Python3
* Root access

# Known issues

* Nothing for snake to eat
* Snake can only go in one of two directions
* No mechanic for snake dying - it just kills the program
* If a new direction isn't selected, the snake dies

# TODO

* Fix known issues
* Add 2-player mode
* Make it actually use colours
